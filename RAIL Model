RAIL is a method to optimize web page while keeping in mind the experience of user. This model breaks down user experience
into smaller goals like - scrolling, tapping, etc and lets the developer focus on them. the full form of RAIL is Response, 
Animation, Idle, Load. Humans' attention period is very small and the developer has to tap onto it to make the web application
better.

The recognition of delay as percieved by humans of tasks are listed below -
0-100ms - at instant
100-300ms - Slightly perceptible delay
300-1000 - task focus, perceptible delay
1000ms - Mental context switch
1000ms-10,000ms - Ill come back later.

Response: process events in under 50ms #
  Goal:
    Complete a transition initiated by user input within 100 ms, so users feel like the interactions are instantaneous.

  Guidelines:
    To ensure a visible response within 100 ms, process user input events within 50 ms. This applies to most inputs, such as 
    clicking buttons, toggling form controls, or starting animations. This does not apply to touch drags or scrolls.

    **Though it may sound counterintuitive, it's not always the right call to respond to user input immediately**. You can 
    use this 100 ms window to do other expensive work, but be careful not to block the user. If possible, do work in the background.

    For actions that take longer than 50 ms to complete, always provide feedback.
